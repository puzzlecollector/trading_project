# Trading Project 
Objective 
- Create a Stat Augmented Reinforcement Learning (SARL) module that is able to trade and make profits.   
  - The SARL will take in news sentiment information, but we can think about more interesting external information that it can take in. 
- Once it is fully developed, use it for real trading competitions and see how it does compared to human traders 
- Investigate using the following techniques
  - Online Deep Learning 
  - Online Reinforcement Learning
  - Mixture Density Networks 
  - Use of Transformers for time series forecasting as well as trading 
  - Look into using drift parameters as input to trading
